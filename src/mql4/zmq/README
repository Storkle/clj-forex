LINUX users:
download/install zeromq (in ubuntu its in repositorys)
download wine-devel (in ubuntu thats what it is called) 
type cmake. in this directory. 

Then place zmq.dll.so in metatrader library folder (experts/libary). Rename this to zmq.dll!

Place include/linux/zmq_native into include folder


WINDOWS users:

ALL USERS:
Place include/zmq_bind into include folder


NOTE: precompile libraries for zmq version 2.0.10 and for the wrappers are available in the libs folder for x86 architecture. I am not sure if the linux wrapper can be used with any wine version, hmm...
