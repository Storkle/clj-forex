note: we are now binding to zeromq libraries - all of this will be automated before i release the code....

LINUX users:
download/install zeromq (in ubuntu its in repositorys)
download wine-devel (in ubuntu thats what it is called) and call 'make' in the linux directory. then place zmq.dll.so in metatrader library folder
(experts/libary). Rename this to zmq.dll!



WINDOWS users:
download/install/compile zeromq. place dll called zmq.dll in experts/libraries.

you need to compile a dll witih the contents of windows.c . You could tecchnically create the structure in metatrader but unfortunately you would have to pass it by reference and it would then look ugly. Also the structure
is implementation dependent, defined by

typedef struct
{
    void *content;
    unsigned char flags;
    unsigned char vsm_size;
    unsigned char vsm_data [ZMQ_MAX_VSM_SIZE];
} zmq_msg_t;

#define ZMQ_MAX_VSM_SIZE 30


Next you need to comment out the zmsg_new in the #import section in zmq_native.mqh and then create a new import statement:

#import "mydll.dll"
int zmsg_new ();
#import



BOTH users:
place include files and script files in appropriate place
