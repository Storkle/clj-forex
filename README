CLJ-forex is an effor to bring forex programming out of the dark ages. While
many institutions (hedge funds,banks) have been using other programming languages, retail forex traders are stuck with the most popular choise, mql4 for metatrader. This is bad. So what clj-forex aims to provide is a socket bridge between metatrader and clojure, to allow expert advisors to be programmed clojure/java side and also allow more complex analysis of price stream data.
