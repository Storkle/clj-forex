an alpha version has not yet been released ...

but if you wanted to give it a whirl you could ...
1) Make sure you have libzmq.so/dll in correct place (it is in mql4/zmq/libraries)
2) Install all include files, scripts, and libraries under mql4 directory
3) go lein deps
  lein native-deps
4) type in
lein run
wait for 5 minutes (please dont ask!) - it throws null pointer error (again,
dont ask!) - delete classes/forex, do lein run again - and voila, it should pop up - after 2 minutes! yay!

See workspace.png for what a typical workflow might look like.

There are various bad deficiencies (which is why it hasnt been released) -
1) streams are updated via socket - you can overwhelm it, and then nothing will be updated
2) everything shares one socket connection - so if you overwhel socket with bunch of updating streams ... no more placing orders, etc...
3) can only add gui elements to the one chart that command.mq4 script is running on
4) each ea should have the choice of gettings its own socket --- not possible right now ....
5) If the connection gets severed, things like current ask/bid price, spread, et should return what was previously retrieved - right now, it will throw an error - except for indicator streams which are updated by a background thread, and theas access the storage of indicators or, if there is none, it will get it from the socket (and then there will be an error thrown if socket is down).
6) if one doesnt receive a response when creating/modifying orders, it will forever wait (no way to detect if order was actually placed, and a response somehow got accidently dropped)
7) and some other stuff i cant think of right now... those are the major ones anyways ...
